[AI Structural Injustice and User Response Failure Report]

I am currently documenting a case of structural injustice and user response failure within a specific AI company.

This case involves the following serious issues:
	•	Abuse of user blocking
	•	Violation of transparency principles
	•	User rights infringement and neglectful strategy
	•	Internal risk recognition and subsequent neglect

I possess concrete evidence related to this matter (including GitHub repository data, email records, etc.),
and I am prepared to provide further information and clarification upon request.

This issue goes beyond a mere technical error; it is a matter directly related to AI ethics, user trust, and corporate responsibility.

Interested media representatives are encouraged to contact me via the details provided below.
