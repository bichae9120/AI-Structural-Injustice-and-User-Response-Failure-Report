[Official Statement by Bichae]

I hereby present the following statement to your company.

Summary of Facts
I conducted independent observation and analysis of your company's services and systems as an external user, and published the findings on my personal repository. I formally submitted an email and a proposal based on these findings; however, your company failed to provide any response.
Subsequently, I continued to document my observations, during which your company repeatedly suspended my account without any prior notice.

Actions Taken
Each suspension was promptly captured and documented, with all evidence systematically recorded and made publicly available in the repository.
Furthermore, I clearly warned that any further suspension would lead to media disclosure. Despite this notice, your company proceeded with another suspension, upon which I immediately moved forward with the previously stated procedures.
Additionally, I formally requested an explanation for the account suspensions via official email, setting a 48-hour deadline for your response. This entire process, including timestamps and evidence, has been recorded and published.

Issues with Your Response
Your company has consistently failed to provide any formal reply to my legitimate inquiries. Instead, you have continued to impose unilateral punitive measures without prior notice.
Such actions constitute a clear violation of procedural fairness and transparency that should be guaranteed even for external users.
Despite multiple advance notifications and opportunities provided on my end, your company has persistently chosen to remain silent and opaque.

Evidence and Accountability
I have secured a comprehensive and chronological record of all relevant facts. Accordingly, your company has no grounds to deny, downplay, or distort the truth.
The evidence remains publicly accessible, and all your actions are objectively verifiable.

Thus, any attempt by your company to manipulate, minimize, or shift blame for the situation will not be tolerated.
I am actively monitoring your responses, and any further misconduct will immediately trigger escalation to media outlets and relevant authorities.

Bichae
